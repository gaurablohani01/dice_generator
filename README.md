# Dice Roller Simulator (ASCII Version)

This is a simple Python program that simulates rolling a six-sided dice and displays the result using ASCII art in the terminal.

## How It Works

- The program uses a dictionary to store ASCII representations of each dice face (from 1 to 6).
- When the user runs the program and presses Enter, the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 6.
- It then prints the rolled number along with the corresponding ASCII dice face.
- After each roll, the user is prompted to either roll again by pressing Enter or exit by typing 'n'.

## Features

- Random dice roll simulation using Python's built-in `random` module.
- Visual display of dice faces using ASCII art.
- User-friendly interface with simple input prompts.
- Looping functionality to allow multiple rolls until the user decides to quit.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script in a terminal or command prompt.
2. Press Enter to roll the dice.
3. View the rolled number and its ASCII dice face.
4. Choose to roll again by pressing Enter or type 'n' to stop.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No external libraries needed.
